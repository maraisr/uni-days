# -----Task Description-----------------------------------------------#
#
#  TREASURE MAP
#
#  This assignment tests your skills at processing data stored in
#  lists, creating reusable code and following instructions to display
#  a complex visual image.  The incomplete Python program below is
#  missing a crucial function, "follow_path".  You are required to
#  complete this function so that when the program is run it traces
#  a path on the screen, drawing "tokens" to indicate discoveries made
#  along the way, while using data stored in a list to determine the
#  steps to be taken.  See the instruction sheet accompanying this
#  file for full details.
#
#  Note that this assignment is in two parts, the second of which
#  will be released only just before the final deadline.  This
#  template file will be used for both parts and you will submit
#  your final solution as a single Python 3 file, whether or not you
#  complete both parts of the assignment.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------#


# -----Preamble-------------------------------------------------------#
#
# This section imports necessary functions and defines constant
# values used for creating the drawing canvas.  You should not change
# any of the code in this section.
#

# Import the functions needed to complete this assignment.  You
# should not need to use any other modules for your solution.  In
# particular, your solution must not rely on any non-standard Python
# modules that need to be downloaded and installed separately,
# because the markers will not have access to such modules.

# To the person marking this, I was given permission to add this import.
# not for partial, but im sure you'd also that, if reduce was allowed.

# Define constant values used in the main program that sets up
# the drawing canvas.  Do not change any of these values.

# -----Functions for Creating the Drawing Canvas----------------------#
#
# The functions in this section are called by the main program to
# manage the drawing canvas for your image.  You should not change
# any of the code in this section.  (Very keen students are welcome
# to draw their own background, provided they do not change the map's
# grid or affect the ability to see it.)
#

# Set up the canvas and draw the background for the overall image
def create_drawing_canvas():
	# Set up the drawing window with enough space for the grid and
	# legend
	setup(window_width, window_height)
	setworldcoordinates(-margin, -margin, window_width - margin,
	                    window_height - margin)

	# Draw as quickly as possible
	tracer(False)

	# Choose a neutral background colour (if you want to draw your
	# own background put the code here, but do not change any of the
	# following code that draws the grid)
	bgcolor('light grey')

	# Get ready to draw the grid
	penup()
	color('slate grey')

	# Draw each of the labels on the y axis
	penup()
	x_offset, y_offset = -5, -10  # pixels
	for y_coord in range(0, (num_squares + 1) * grid_size, grid_size):
		goto(x_offset, y_coord + y_offset)

# system.  By default the cursor (turtle) is hidden when the
# program ends - call the function with False as the argument to
# prevent this.

# -----Test Data for Use During Code Development----------------------#
#
# The "fixed" data sets in this section are provided to help you
# develop and test your code.  You can use them as the argument to
# the follow_path function while perfecting your solution.  However,
# they will NOT be used to assess your program.  Your solution will
# be assessed using the random_path function appearing below.  Your
# program must work correctly for any data set that can be generated
# by the random_path function.
#
# Each of the data sets is a list of instructions expressed as
# triples.  The instructions have two different forms.  The first
# instruction in the data set is always of the form
#
#     ['Start', location, token_number]
#
# where the location may be 'Top left', 'Top right', 'Centre',
# 'Bottom left' or 'Bottom right', and the token_number is an
# integer from 0 to 4, inclusive.  This instruction tells us where
# to begin our treasure hunt and the token that we find there.
# (Every square we visit will yield a token, including the first.)
#
# The remaining instructions, if any, are all of the form
#
#     [direction, number_of_squares, token_number]
#
# where the direction may be 'North', 'South', 'East' or 'West',
# the number_of_squares is a positive integer, and the token_number
# is an integer from 0 to 4, inclusive.  This instruction tells
# us where to go from our current location in the grid and the
# token that we will find in the target square.  See the instructions
# accompanying this file for examples.

# -----Function for Assessing Your Solution---------------------------#
#
# The function in this section will be used to assess your solution.
# Do not change any of the code in this section.
#
# The following function creates a random data set specifying a path
# to follow.  Your program must work for any data set that can be
# returned by this function.  The results returned by calling this
# function will be used as the argument to your follow_path function
# during marking.  For convenience during code development and
# marking this function also prints the path to be followed to the
# shell window.
#
# Note: For brevity this function uses some Python features not taught
# in IFB104 (dictionaries and list generators).  You do not need to
# understand this code to complete the assignment.

# -----Student's Solution---------------------------------------------#
#
#  Complete the assignment by replacing the dummy function below with
#  your own "follow_path" function.
#

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# To the person marking this, I can see pydoc is a thing, however its a syntax
# im not used to at all - however I've tried to adapt, javadoc/jsdoc/tsdoc etc..
# to Python, for our documentation. Usually when I code, I don't document nearly
# as much as I am in the body's of the functions. That usually gets done by way
# of unit tests. But in this case, and to prove I actually understand what I'm
# coding, I've explained it best I can, where I can. This is also my very first
# exposure to Python, so please also excuse if things aren't quit done the
# Python way.

# ---- Token draw functions ----

# To the person marking this, this was actually my most hated part of the
